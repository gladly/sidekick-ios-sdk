# Gladly Chat SDK Example App
This is a simple iOS App that serves as an example of how to use the Gladly Chat SDK.

The `appId` in `AppDelegate.swift` needs to be replaced with an appId given to you by Gladly to run this application.

Push notifications will not work out of the box, for that to work Gladly must configure APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) certificate that is configured on an app specific basis.
