# Gladly Chat SDK Example App
This is a simple iOS App that serves as an example of how to use the Gladly Chat SDK.

To run the example application:
1. Clone this repository.
1. Open the Example project in Xcode.
1. Drag in the latest release of the SDK as a dependency.
1. Replace the `appId` in `AppDelegate.swift` with a value given to you by Gladly.

Push notifications will not work out of the box, for that to work Gladly must configure APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) certificate that is configured on an app specific basis.
